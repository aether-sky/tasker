# Tasker
Tasker is a discord bot that allows users to commit to focused time for a set number of minutes. Each session is tracked and the user can ask for a summary of their sessions.

## Commands:
**/session** - Begin a session for a specified duration of time. Optionally one can provide a summary of what work they intend to accomplish during the session and how many minutes in the future the session will begin.

Sessions are completed by clicking the "Complete session" button attached to the bot's response.

**/summary** - Provides a summary of how many sessions and how much total focused time the user has finished.
